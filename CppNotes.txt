Best Practices Only:
1_Basics.cpp
    Brace initialization gives better performance compared to normal initialization.
    \n is better than endl.
    Use snake case or camel case for variable names.
2_Functions.cpp
    Nested functions are not supported in c++. Error on line 5.
    Note the line no. 23 i.e same as int num = getValueFromUser();
3_ForwardDec.cpp
    It is also called as function prototyping or forward declaration.
    Like in line no. 3, it is best to forward declare it with the parameters and to not do just int add(int, int);
